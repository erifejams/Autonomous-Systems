# Autonomous-Systems
Autonomous system is a system which contains a group of IP(Internet Protocol) routing prefixes
that follows predefined policies on how information is sent and received within and outside the
network. This relates to our project because our dataset gives information about a computer
network system. We have a system of computers that are connected to many servers and in this
system information is sent and received through these connections.

<br>
Link Analysis is used to help understand the relationship between our system which is made up
of computers and servers. In this report, we formulate questions and answer these questions as
we go through steps to preprocess our data and preform link analyses. We learn more about the
relationship between the server and computer through the use of centralities in link analyses and
displaying these graphs.

We compared and evaluated different centralities for our dataset, to understand more the relationship between computers and servers. Refer to the **Report.pdf** to see a more indepth explanation of our data preprocesssing, analysis and link analysis steps.<br>
